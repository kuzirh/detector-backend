# detector-backend
## This project is OBE'd due to complications with deploying pytesseract binaries and modules needed to run pytesseract to AWS.
## I have decided to just use AWS Native service Textract for my use case.

I will keep the repo here though in case there is a breakthrough on an easier way to deploy tesseract-ocr to AWS without having to provision an EC2 instance.
